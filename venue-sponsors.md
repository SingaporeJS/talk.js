# Talk.js Venue Sponsorship Rider

This [rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(theater)) is a set of minimum requirements for talk.js venue sponsors. These requirements are set in place to help make sure talk.js meetups run smoothly and are comfortable experiences for all involved.

## Clear & specific instructions on how to find & access the venue

Please describe how to find and access your venue in a detailed manner as if you were telling your boss and they'd never been to your building, or even to Singapore before. Make it foolproof. Indeed in the past there have been attendees who literally arrived in Singapore for the first time only hours prior to arriving at the meetup. Descriptions of nearby landmarks and even photos of entraces would be fantastic. We will put this content up on the meetup event page.

## Someone to man the door for latecomers, up to the 30 minute mark

If your venue security restricts access, someone needs to man the door for up to 30 minutes after the scheduled start time for *talks*. e.g. if doors open at 7:00pm, but talks start at 7:30pm, someone needs to man the door until 8:00pm. Some people only plan to arrive at the commencement of the talks and they shouldn't be locked out if they're late. We can offer a volunteer to help with this if needed.

## A/C must not be switched off

Some venues have A/C that is automatically switched off after a certain time. A/C must not be switched off during the meetup, and should provide at least 30 minutes of allowance after the scheduled meetup end time. 

## Microphones & Someone who knows how to use them

Someone needs to be on-hand to set up the microphone system and make sure it's functional, or at least show an organiser how to do so. Ideally there will be a quick sound-check before the meetup starts. **Never assume it's ok to let people speak unamplified**, many speakers have trouble projecting their voice for the entire duration of their talk, and not everyone has perfect hearing. 

The following quote is from [What You're Saying When You Say "I Don't Need a Mic"](https://www.uua.org/worship/lab/what-youre-saying-when-you-say-i-dont-need-mic)

> To all of those who have trouble hearing, these are the messages you’re sending when you say, “I don’t need a microphone” (or just don't bother using one):
> 
> * "I can hear fine, and everyone is just like me.”
> * "I'm assuming that everyone can hear me, so it’s your problem if you can't.”
> * "My belief that ‘I can project’ matters more to me than your ability to hear.”
> * "My discomfort in hearing my own amplified voice is more important than your need to be included.”
> * "If you really want me to use a microphone, you’ll have to assert yourself to request and/or justify that need (which will likely be uncomfortable).”
> * "I am willing to exclude people.”

## Accessibility Information

Is your venue accessible to people with disabilities? Is there wheelchair access to the venue & to bathrooms? Does your venue offer a [hearing loop](https://www.hearinglink.org/living/loops-equipment/hearing-loops/what-is-a-hearing-loop/). Please advise us about the accessibility status so we can advertise this to attendees.

## Details about bathrooms and drinking water

At the start of the meetup attendees should be made aware of how to access the nearest bathrooms & drinking water.
