## 📝 Notes to speakers

- Be punctual for the event; talks start at 7.30pm - _your talk may be rescheduled if you are late_
- Bring your own equipment - _laptops, video adapters, power adapters, presenter clickers, etc._
- Request for wifi access from the host
- RSVP on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS) for the event - _this is for building security clearance_
