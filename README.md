# talk.js

A monthly meet up for all things JavaScript, Node.js, and the modern web.

Find us on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/).

## How to propose a talk

There's usually a corresponding [issue](https://github.com/SingaporeJS/talk.js/issues) for each talk.js for the month (raise an issue if one has not been created yet). Leave a comment for your talk proposal under the issue that corresponds with the month you'd like to give your talk.

Raise an [issue](https://github.com/SingaporeJS/talk.js/issues) (preferred) if you have further questions, suggestions, or feedback. You may also ping the organizers on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/SingaporeJS/organizers).
