## How to propose a talk

There's usually a corresponding [issue](https://github.com/SingaporeJS/talk.js/issues) for each talk.js for the month (raise an issue if one has not been created yet). To propose a talk simply leave a comment in an issue for that month.

## Notes to speakers

- **Be punctual for the event** - your talk may be rescheduled if you are late
- **Bring your own equipment** - laptops, video adapters, power adapters, presenter clickers, etc.
